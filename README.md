# Encord Image Prediction App

This is a single page application built with React that allows users to upload, manage and predict images.

## Requirements

- json-server
- npm or yarn

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine
2.  In the project directory, run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the necessary dependencies.
3.  Run the API server by navigating to the `json-server` directory and running `json-server --watch db.json --port 3000`
4.  In another terminal window, navigate back to the project directory and run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the React development server.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001` to view the app.

## Additional Information

The app uses the json-server package to stub out the API requests. The images and prediction data are stored in a db.json file in the json-server directory. The API server runs on localhost:3000, while the React development server runs on localhost:3001.
